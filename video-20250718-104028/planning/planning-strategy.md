The basic prompt '猫の動画作って' was analyzed to extract core elements: cat, action, setting, and style. For image generation (Imagen4 Fast), the focus was on static visual beauty, emphasizing details like fur, eyes, lighting, and composition, with keywords for high quality. For video generation (Hailuo-02 Pro), the emphasis shifted to dynamic movements, transitions, and a narrative flow, ensuring suitability for image-to-video conversion with motion-centric keywords. Both prompts include technical quality enhancements and are concise.
